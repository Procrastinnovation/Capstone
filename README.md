# Capstone
Capstone project for STL blu sensor

1. Project Scope

	This product is a motion tracker for Taekwondo athletes to help improve their kicks. Each sensor that user is wearing around their legs will produce x, y, and z coordination along with acceleration of the kick. Once the main device converts these inputs into the program, the data analysis will output the result that user can interpretive and produces tangible data that they can compare to their own and others.
	
1.1 Project Title

Martial Art Movement Tracker (A wearable device to track the movement of a Taekwondo athlete)

1.2. Project Goal

	The goal of this project is to build a training tool for martial artist such as Taekwondo athletes. To measure and enhance athlete’s performance in terms of accuracy, speed, angle and other important aspects of the movements, this training wearable technology can collect and output quantitative data that user can verify and adapt to increase their abilities to help achieve their personal training goal. Another aspect of this project is to build this training tool as asynchronous so, that the instructor or the athletes do not have to meet physically. By sharing information of the output may help athletes and the instructors to help each other when they are not in the same location and same time. 
	
	In sparring competition for example, Taekwondo committee is using a chest protector with a helmet and sensors on the kicker’s instep to trigger points when a certain threshold occurs from a kick. And whoever have the most point in the end wins. Now, this does not track how or what kind of kick it was exactly used. With this device, we can create an audit event log of each fight where we can see every movement and maybe even recreate the fight match if we can convert these data to visualization in future. For my project’s goal, it will not be in a visual graphic but it will be in terms of charts and data that user can use such as kicking angles, speed and rhythm.
